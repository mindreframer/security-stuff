cryptobox

CryptoBox aims to provide similar functionality to NaCL[1], while using
FIPS ciphers. It provides the following packages:

* box: secure and authenticate small messages with 20-year security
  using public key cryptography.
* stoutbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 50-year security
  using public key cryptography.

* secretbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 20-year security.
* strongbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 50-year security.

Developers should prefer the box and stoutbox packages, as these reduce the
possibility of key compromise by using public keys.

cryptobox operates on the concept of "boxes", which are encrypted and
authenticated secure messages. Boxes operate under the following threat model:

* Messages should be confidential, but it is not a concern that Eve can
  determine the length of the message.
* The communicating parties have some means of authenticating keys on
  their own; that is, this package provides no authentication outside
  of the keys themselves. There is no identity bound to a key.
